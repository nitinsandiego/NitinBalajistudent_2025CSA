    "The Student Management System project is a demonstration of various key concepts from the AP Computer Science A curriculum. This interactive system allows users to add, search, delete, and display student records, as well as calculate the average GPA of the students. It showcases how primitive data types, object-oriented programming, and data structures like ArrayLists are used in real-world applications. By including conditional statements, loops, and recursion, the project not only highlights understanding of basic control structures but also demonstrates problem-solving through algorithms and managing data efficiently. This project effectively integrates all ten units of CSA, displaying a comprehensive grasp of Java programming."

    "  - Contains attributes (`name`, `studentID`, `gpa`), a constructor, and methods like `getName()`, `getStudentID()`, and `getGpa()`.\n",
    "  - This encapsulation allows you to work with student data in a well-organized way.\n",
    "- **Overriding `toString()`**:\n",
