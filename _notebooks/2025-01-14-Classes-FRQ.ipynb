    "This question was pretty straightforward. The only thing that I had to be careful about was the logic in the canSeat method. I had to make sure that I was subtracting 2 from the sum of the seats of the two tables before comparing it with the number of people that needed to be seated. The also kind of tricky bit was calculating the average of the view qualities of the two tables. I had to make sure that I was dividing by 2 and for when it wasn't the same height, I had make sure I remebered to subtract 10. Overall, this question was pretty easy."
