Week at a glance.

Tuesday we have a short day.

Wednesday I will do a short lecture to get us started on Java/Spring backend for Trimester 1 PBL project.

Wednesday to Friday we will have reviews.  We will be closing on Units #1-#9.   I have provided checklists in order for you to prepare for a detail review that we will start Wednesday.   Review needs to be done before end of class on Friday.   

Do not wait until the end!!!
