## Concepts: Array Creation and Access (Unit 6.1) - Aditya

Arrays are one-dimensional data structures used to store a collection of primitive or object reference data

- Elements of an array can be accessed through indexing
- Must be same datatype
- No negative indexing in Java
- Cannot change length of array

## Concepts: Traversing Arrays (Unit 6.2) - Nitin

Traversing arrays involves accessing each element sequentially:

- Uses a for loop with an index
- Index allows access or modification of elements
- Array length is important to prevent out-of-bounds errors
- Common for tasks like searching, sorting, or updating arrays

## Concepts: Enhanced For Loops for Arrays (Unit 6.3) - Akhil

- Enhanced for loops are a simplified version of regular for loops, with some twists:
- No indexing variable
- Cannot modify the original variables in the array

## Concepts: Developing Algorithms Using Arrays (Unit 6.4) - Srini

Developing algorithms with arrays involves manipulating array data to solve problems:

- Use loops to traverse and process array elements
- Common tasks include summing elements, finding minimum/maximum values
- Arrays are often used for storing and manipulating data efficiently
- Algorithms can involve sorting, searching, or modifying array content

## How will we teach this?

- Set up three different stations on the the three Ditto screens. 6.1 will be on the left, 6.2 on the right, and 6.3 and 6.4 in the middle.
- Each station will be about 20 minutes long, with a 10 minute lesson and a 10 minute hack.
- There will be 3 rotations, allowing students to experience all three subtopics.
