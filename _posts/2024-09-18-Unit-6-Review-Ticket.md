## Concepts: Array Creation and Access (Unit 6.1)

Arrays are one-dimensional data structures used to store a collection of primitive or object reference data

- Elements of an array can be accessed through indexing
- Must be same datatype
- No negative indexing in Java
- Cannot change length of array

## Concepts: Traversing Arrays (Unit 6.2)

Traversing arrays involves accessing each element sequentially:

- Uses a for loop with an index
- Index allows access or modification of elements
- Array length is important to prevent out-of-bounds errors
- Common for tasks like searching, sorting, or updating arrays


## Concepts: Enhanced For Loops (Unit 6.3)

- Enhanced for loops are a simplified version of regular for loops, with some twists:
- No indexing variable
- Cannot modify the original variables in the array
