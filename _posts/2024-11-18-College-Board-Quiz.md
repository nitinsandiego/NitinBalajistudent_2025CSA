## Corrections

Question 4
![alt text](images/Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 9.13.09 AM.png)
I chose B or 2.3333333, where the correct answer was 2 or C. The reason B was incorrect because this would be the result if the division used was floating point division, instead of integer division. This would be the case if either x or y were of type double instead of type int or if either value was typecast as a double in the expression. 
C is correct because when we evaluate the express(x < 10) && (y < 0) for x having the value 7 and y having the value 3, x < 10 evaluates to true, since 7 is less than 10, and y < 0 evaluates to false, since 3 is not less than 0. The logic operator && evaluates to true when both conditions are true and evaluates to false otherwise. Since the second condition is false, the boolean expression is false. As a result, the compiler will skip the first output statement and execute the statement in the else. The expression x / y is integer division for 7 / 3, which is 2.

## Reflection

I got a 36/40 on the quiz which is a 90%. I think I did very well, but also I think I took a long time. I think I need to work on going faster through the questions, which will better prepare me for the AP Exam
