Curve for AP CSA classes.  Every class is different.

P1 - 88.5 % is A

P3 - 89% is A

If you are lower you really need to focus in on you Sprint 3 - CSA objectives and live review if you want to work for a Grade Bump.

Big things to consider.

Sprint 3 CSA Objectives will be part of initial seed determination.

We will be working on integrating your projects into my space the 1st week and perhaps beyond.  You will likely need to work cross period to accomplish this task.

I will be posting a CSA MC's to take over finals and will be due toward the beginning of week 1.
