Every group should start preparing for their college board lesson immediately.  They are due next Thu 9/18 at beginning of class.

This is your 1st project and will show me your ability to plan and coordinate together.   This should be considered a midterm project (very valuable).
Here are some tips...

There is a lesson from last year provided in portfolio_2025 for your unit.
All lessons should be revised to follow format I have provided on Unit 1.   By beginning of class on the 9/18 you will have a pull request for https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025

Lessons will be taught in clumps (1,3,4), (2, 5, 9), (6,7,8).   It would be advisable that you start some Slack channels across periods to share ideas and avoid redundancy.  Remember, you have Office Hours for collaboration.  

We will schedule clumps next Thu.  Some people will be Teaching on Friday 9/19.
Follow 3 X (10 minute Tech Talk/10 minute Hack) format.   You should have more material than you teach and hopefully students can. be 85% complete with your lesson by the end of the period.
