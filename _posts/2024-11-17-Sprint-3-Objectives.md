Sprint 3 CSA objectives and MCQ are due next week ^.  Take care of this work, don't waste class time,

Be aware that some of your team members may need help.  Remember I am always in observation of those who are trying to excel in CompSci, a key skill is lifting others through collaboration or looking forward: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csa/sprint4/objectives

Several will be doing live reviews with me on older work this week to get a grade boost.  If you are one of them: 1. don't be sloppy 2. know what you want to show and why.
