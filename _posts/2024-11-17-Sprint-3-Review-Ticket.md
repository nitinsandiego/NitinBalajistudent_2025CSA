| Work Habits (Analytics)    | 1             |     0.92      |     Backend ![image](images/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 9.41.15 PM.png)  Frontend ![image](images/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 9.42.07 PM.png) ![images](images/binary/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 2.46.49 PM.png) I always am present in class and participate in class discussions. Also, my GitHub analytics display my dedication to investing time and effort into my learning in CSA and into the team project.     |
| Evidence of Role in Team   | 1             |        0.91   |       My role in the team was scrum master. This means I oversaw what each person did and distributing roles and tasks to other team members. Also, I my role consists of merging our into the class frontend and backend repositories. ![image](images/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 9.56.13 PM.png) ![image](images/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 9.57.02 PM.png)       | 
| Function / Purpose Design  | 1             |     0.9      |     The purpose of this project is to help Mr. Mortensen manage his CSSE, CSP, and CSA classes more easily. It will help him keep track of student information, organize group assignments, and monitor progress in different courses. This will save time, allowing Mr. Mortensen to focus more on teaching and less on keeping track of progress of each team. Our project was inspired by the organizational tools found in platforms like Monday.com, which is a popular work management software used for team collaboration. Monday.com allows users to create detailed boards for tracking tasks, projects, and workflows. It provides a visual way to assign tasks, monitor progress, and collaborate within teams, making it a versatile tool for organizing work in an efficient manner. Seeing the functionality of Monday.com, we decided to apply a similar concept to classroom management. The idea is to provide Mr. Mortensen with a tool to manage his CSSE, CSP, and CSA classes more effectively, similar to how Monday.com enables team management. By tracking students, assignments, and progress in one place, our project mirrors Monday.com’s ability to handle task assignments and group organization, but it tailors these features specifically for the educational context.         |
