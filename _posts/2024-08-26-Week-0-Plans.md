## Things to Do by Tuesday

- We will register all users in the Student database (Kasm users have already done this).
- You should make your own personal GitHub repo customized to your own name: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student_2025).
  - Two changes to match the repo name are in `_config.yml`.
  - One change to match the repo name is in the `Makefile`.
- We will verify the 1st code commits, such as modifying the home page, modifying the about page, and creating a new page capturing memories from Tools Setup.
- Consider abbreviating the pages I provided to make them specific to your needs.
  - Perhaps hacks could be captured inline with the menu.
- You should have verified tools: [Verify Tools](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/verify).
  - Be careful if you allow output of this in your posted pages, as it may break the search functionality.
- Today, you should explore: [Pages Play](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/github/pages/play).
- Complete the hacks by Tuesday: [Hacks](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/hacks).
- On Wednesday, we need to update to version `.7` and start a checklist to complete the sprint.
