- Stay updated on emerging trends and technologies in the STEM field to remain adaptable.
    - AI is a very fast growing field that I am interested in, and I will need to continue to learn about as it rapidly grows and changes

### Gaining Experience
- Actively seek internships to gain hands-on experience and expand professional networks.

    - Could be even a project among friends

### Education and Skills
- Research and apply to educational programs or certifications aligned with career goals, not just "top" institutions.
    - Look and apply for programs that actually will help me and give me valuable experience, not ones that are just prestigious
- Explore tools like UML diagrams to improve problem-solving and organizational abilities.
    - Great tool that I use in my AP CSA class that I will continue to use in the future
- Regularly participate in hackathons or STEM competitions to apply knowledge in practical settings.

### Resume and Portfolio
- Update the resume to emphasize projects, internships, and key technical skills.
    - I already have an resume but regulary updating it will help me in the future
- Develop a professional portfolio website that integrates GitHub repositories and showcases completed work.
    - I have always wanted to make a personal website displaying my projects, but never knew how good it looks in interviews

- Reflect on feedback from peers and mentors to continuously improve.
