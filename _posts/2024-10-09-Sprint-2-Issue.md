This allowed us to teach our unit with a better student-to-teacher ratio. Because of this, Mr. Mortenson recognized this unique approach and gave us a 0.93.    |

| Presentation Memories      |   1           |    0.93       |        Had a great time working with my team and created a lot of memories. From this experience in a team setting, I have grown my leadership skills and my ability to work on a collaborative level with others to achieve shared goals. This opportunity has also taught me the importance of effective communication and adaptability in dynamic environments.  ![050CAEF0-BD17-4552-8EC7-F2217028D168](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d7e5f3c-7151-4ccc-83c4-4d2a256bba19)   |
| Grading and Feedback       |   1           |      0.87     |       [Grading sheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KP8wh_XzqnP0r-tA84VKDCfYroQ0srIY3iz3hScC3OI/edit?usp=sharing)  <br> Our grading was correct, but our scale was off, altering the scores. This led to a uneven and incorrect scores. This experience taught to pay more attention to this and focuses on the scaling or grading of homework.     |
| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |       0.93    |       We implemented a distinctive and innovative teaching approach by setting up multiple stations, each dedicated to different topics or activities. This method allowed us to break the larger class into smaller, more manageable groups, making it easier to provide personalized attention and cater to individual learning needs. By rotating students through the stations, we were able to create an interactive learning environment that promoted engagement, encouraged hands-on learning, and made complex concepts easier to grasp. This structure not only enhanced student understanding but also improved the overall teaching efficiency.     |
