Hello! My name is Nitin Balaji, and I'm 16 years old. From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our world. This curiosity has driven me to pursue a path in coding, and I’m thrilled about the endless possibilities it offers. My ultimate dream is to work as a software engineer, where I can contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.

Beyond coding, I have a deep passion for Formula 1 racing. The thrill of the race, the precision of the engineering, and the sheer determination of the drivers captivate me. My favorite team is Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team, and I admire Lewis Hamilton not just for his incredible talent on the track but also for his resilience and advocacy off it.

But my interests don’t stop there. I’m also an enthusiastic NFL fan, and you’ll often find me cheering for the Denver Broncos. The strategy, teamwork, and excitement of football make it a sport I love to follow.

Another passion of mine is collecting sneakers. As a sneakerhead, I appreciate the artistry and culture behind each pair of shoes. Every collection tells a story, and I enjoy being part of that vibrant community.

Academically, I’m currently taking AP Computer Science A (AP CSA), and I’m eager to dive deeper into software development. I look forward to expanding my knowledge through future software courses, and I’m excited about the journey ahead in the world of tech.
